# One-Topology

## OneTopology: Precision at scale
OneTopology processes reconcile Source tenant topology with Target tenant topology, as One Topology.
- Configurations from the Source tenant will land on the right entities, even if their IDs change during the migration process (Host, Synthetic test, Application, Service, etc.).
- It is optimised for speed and precision.
- Ensures that you will not be limited to the Config Manager.
- You can keep using Configuration as Code (aka Monaco), Terraform or UI screens in parallel without breaking Config Manager functionalities.


## Credits
One-Topology is based on a fork of Monaco project v2.0 (dynatrace-config-as-code).
