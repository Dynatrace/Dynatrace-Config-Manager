# Dynatrace-Config-Manager

### ALPHA VERSION

##### Disclaimer:

* I made my code available to everyone, but this project is not stable for now.
* Error management is minimal, this should be fixed soon.
* It is not officially supported in any way by Dynatrace or myself.
* Use at your own risks.

### Vision:
I am working towards a "one click migration" for all oneangents and and of their tenant's configuration to another tenant.

### Functionalities (Animated Gifs):

##### Match entities between 2 tenants
